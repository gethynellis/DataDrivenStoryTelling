## **Exercise: Apply Data Story Framework to Your Data**

**Goal:** Learn to frame a data story using the *Building a Data Story* framework so that your insights drive action.

This is a group activity - you will be split into groups. Someone needs to be the scribe to jot down your notes and thoughts to these steps and present them back to the class

### **Choose Your Dataset**

* Pick a dataset that matters to your role or organisation.
* Examples:

  * Customer churn rates
  * Service complaints
  * Sales performance by region
  * Website traffic and conversions
  * Employee engagement survey results

If you don’t have a dataset in mind, use a simple shared one provided by the trainer (e.g., sample customer churn data).

###  Identify the Hero 

* In data storytelling, the hero is your **audience**.
* Ask: *Who needs to make a decision with this data?*

  * Exec team?
  * Service managers?
  * Customers?
  * Donors/funders?

Write this into the “Hero” box on your template.

---

### **Define the Problem**

* What challenge does your dataset highlight?
* Frame it as a **business problem**, not just a data point.

  * Example: *“Complaints are increasing”* (not just “complaints = 312 last quarter”).
* Keep it simple and relatable.

Fill in the “Problem” box on your template.

---

### **Position the Guide**

* Remember: you (the analyst/consultant) are not the hero. You are the **guide**.
* Think: *What role do I play in helping my audience understand and act on this problem?*
* Example: “I analyse customer feedback and identify key churn drivers.”

Write your role in the “Guide” box.

---

### **Outline the Plan**

* Translate insights into a **clear, simple narrative arc**:

  * **Beginning**: Why this matters (context)
  * **Middle**: What the data shows (insights)
  * **End**: What should be done (recommendation)
* Example: “Improve onboarding experience by automating tutorials and adding welcome calls.”

Fill in the “Plan” box.

---

### **Call to Action**

* Define the **decision or action** your audience should take.
* Make it specific and actionable.
* Example: “Assign resources to customer support and onboarding.”

Write this in the “CTA” box.

---

### **State the Stakes**

* Show the **impact of action vs inaction**:

  * *If we act → Save £1m revenue.*
  * *If we don’t → Churn rises by 10%.*
* Be explicit: what’s at stake if your audience ignores the data?

Add this to the “Stakes” box.

---

### Share & Discuss**

*We will reconvene and each group will present their findings back to the class
* Pair up or form small groups.
* Present your  data story in **2 minutes each**.
* Provide feedback: Was the problem clear? Was the CTA compelling?
