# Case Study â€“ Bettershire Council Complaints System

## Background

Bettershire Council recently implemented a new **Complaints Management System** as part of its digital transformation programme. This new platform consolidates all customer complaints into a single system, replacing fragmented manual processes.

The change was driven by two key needs:

* To comply with strict regulatory requirements for statutory complaints.
* To improve responsiveness and transparency across all council services.

The system has now been live for around six months, providing the first unified dataset for analysis. During this time, the Digital Transformation Team ensured that:

* Comprehensive data is captured (complaint category, dates, outcomes).
* All channels (online, phone, email, in person, letter) are integrated.
* Staff are trained to use the new system and its reporting tools.

This case study explores the early insights from the system, highlights the differences between statutory and corporate complaints, and demonstrates how meaningful stories can be told even with limited data. It also illustrates how the Digital Transformation Team added value throughout the process.

## Statutory vs Corporate Complaints â€“ Different Needs

Bettershire Council operates two parallel complaints procedures:

* **Statutory Complaints** â€“ e.g. complaints about Adult Social Care or Childrenâ€™s Services, which are legally regulated. Reporting focuses on compliance: response timeliness, correct process stages, and provision of advocacy where required.

* **Corporate Complaints** â€“ complaints about all other services, managed under the Councilâ€™s own policies. Reporting here focuses on service improvement, customer experience, and operational performance (e.g. average response times, upheld rates, themes by department).

Because the two procedures have different audiences and KPIs, reports are produced separately but reviewed side-by-side by senior leadership. Statutory reports demonstrate compliance, while corporate reports drive internal service improvement.

## Using the First 6 Months of Data

In the first six months:

* **Volume of Complaints** â€“ Around *120 complaints* were recorded (20 per month). 60% were corporate, 40% statutory. The small rise compared to the previous manual system suggests more complete capture of customer feedback.

* **Categories and Themes** â€“ Early analysis showed recurring themes such as *communication delays* in corporate complaints and *quality of care* in statutory complaints. One unit received 15 complaints about service delays, which led to refresher training on customer communication.

* **Timeliness of Responses** â€“ 100% of statutory complaints met the legal resolution timeframe (most resolved within 30â€“60 days). 85% of corporate complaints were closed within the internal 20-day target. Bottlenecks were identified in one department during a staff shortage, prompting resource adjustments.

* **Outcomes and Resolutions** â€“ Around *40% of complaints were upheld*. This helped identify service areas with systemic issues. Remedies included apologies, process changes, and in some cases financial redress.

These insights were presented in a **Complaints Performance Dashboard**, using simple visuals (trends, statutory vs corporate split, category breakdowns). Early storytelling focused on context: e.g. a spike in month 2 was linked to a known service outage.

## Telling Meaningful Stories with Early Data

With a limited dataset, the Council emphasised storytelling techniques:

* **Contextualising metrics** â€“ e.g. explaining that a rise in complaints reflected increased accessibility rather than declining service.
* **Humanising data** â€“ anonymised quotes were used to give residentsâ€™ voices to the numbers.
* **Highlighting early wins** â€“ e.g. complaints about a facilityâ€™s cleanliness dropped to zero after cleaning schedules were increased.
* **Keeping visuals simple** â€“ trend lines, bar charts, and pie charts to make data easy to scan and understand.

## Value Added by the Digital Transformation Team

The teamâ€™s contributions included:

* Designing a **user-friendly, multi-channel system** so no complaint is missed.
* Building **compliance workflows** that enforce statutory deadlines.
* Integrating the system with **reporting tools** like Power BI for real-time monitoring.
* **Upskilling staff** with training in both the system and data analysis.
* Establishing **continuous improvement loops**, adapting categories and workflows based on feedback.

## Evolving the Story as More Data Accrues

Six months provided only a baseline. The next phases will focus on:

* Establishing **benchmarks and seasonal trends** with 12+ months of data.
* Refining the **narrative** to track long-term improvements and outcomes.
* Introducing **advanced analytics** such as text analysis for emerging issues.
* Embedding a **feedback loop**: complaints â†’ service improvements â†’ re-measured outcomes.
* Publishing **annual complaints performance reports** for public transparency.

## Conclusion

Bettershire Councilâ€™s first six months with the new Complaints Management System show the potential of combining technology, data, and storytelling. The system is already improving compliance, responsiveness, and staff capability.

As more data accrues, Bettershire Council will move from reporting baselines to demonstrating sustained improvement â€” closing the loop between citizen feedback and tangible service excellence.

ðŸ‘‰ This streamlined version is easier for **workshop participants** to use when:

* Mapping stakeholders.
* Identifying stories in the data.
* Practising narrative frameworks (e.g. hero, problem, guide, plan, stakes).

Would you like me to also create a **shorter, workshop-ready handout version** (1â€“2 pages with just the essentials + some blank space for participant notes), so you can give it out as a working document during activities?
