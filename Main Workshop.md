# Crafting a Complaints Data Story ‚Äì Hands‚ÄêOn Lab Guide

## Workshop Goal
Learn to transform raw complaints data into a compelling data story using a proven narrative framework. Participants will work in small groups (up to 5) to contextualise the data, humanise insights, and define clear actions ‚Äì all without focusing on technical tools.  

This **1.5-hour session** is set in the context of a public-sector Complaints System transformation (e.g. a new centralised complaints database with six months of data).  

By the end, each group will have crafted a short narrative (hero‚Äôs journey) about their complaints data and shared it with the workshop.

## Narrative Framework
Every good story has key ingredients:

- **Hero**: The main character ‚Äì in our case, the target audience or decision-maker who cares about the issue.  
- **Problem**: The core challenge or question illustrated by the data (e.g. rising complaints, slow response times).  
- **Guide**: The data analyst or team who provides expertise (that‚Äôs you!).  
- **Plan**: The proposed solution or approach ‚Äì backed by data (e.g. focus on top complaint categories, process improvements).  
- **Call to Action (CTA)**: A clear recommendation ‚Äì what should the hero do next?  
- **Outcome**: The positive result if the plan is adopted (success scenario).  
- **Stakes**: The consequences if no action is taken (failure scenario).  

üëâ In data storytelling for public services:  
- The **audience** (manager/director) is the **hero**.  
- The **business challenge** is the **problem**.  
- **You (the analysts)** are the **guide**.  
- The **data analysis** provides the **plan**.  
- The story concludes with a **call to action**, an **outcome**, and the **stakes**.  

Throughout the lab:  
- Focus on storytelling, not dashboards.  
- Know your audience (hero).  
- Contextualise data (explain the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù).  
- Humanise insights (real people behind stats).  
- Use a logical narrative arc: **Beginning ‚Üí Middle ‚Üí End**.

## 1. Introduction & Setup (10 minutes)

**Purpose:** Set the stage, form groups, clarify objectives, and introduce the storytelling framework.  

**Instructions:**
- **Form Small Groups:** Up to 5 people, mixing roles for diverse perspectives.  
- **Overview the Scenario:**  
  > ‚ÄúWe have implemented a new centralised complaints management system. We‚Äôve gathered 6 months of complaint data across all channels. Our task is to turn this data into a meaningful story for stakeholders.‚Äù  
- **Recap Story Framework:** Hero, Problem, Guide, Plan, Outcome, Call to Action, Stakes.  
- **Hook Their Interest:** Stories make data memorable, persuasive, and actionable.  

**Example (Fictional):**  
Bettershire Council has a new complaints system. The hero might be the **Head of Customer Service**, concerned about rising complaint numbers. We, the analysts, will guide them through what the data says and what to do about it.

## 2. Identify the Hero and Problem (10 minutes)

**Purpose:** Establish the **beginning** of your story.  

**Instructions:**
- **Define Your Hero (Audience):** Who needs to hear this story and act on it?  
- **Frame the Problem:** Identify the key business challenge in the data.  
- **Capture Context:** Write a short statement (Who, What, When, Where).  

**Example (Fictional):**  
Maria, the Customer Service Director at Bettershire Council, faces a 25% surge in complaints in the past six months ‚Äì and she doesn‚Äôt know why.  

---

## 3. Introduce the Guide and Outline the Plan (10 minutes)

**Purpose:** Transition to the **middle** ‚Äì define the guide and outline the plan.  

**Instructions:**
- **Establish the Guide:** Analysts are helpers, not heroes.  
- **Outline the Plan:** Keep it simple. Example approaches:  
  - Analyse trends over time.  
  - Break down complaints by category.  
  - Review performance metrics (resolution times, outcomes).  
  - Identify root causes.  
- **Keep It Logical:** A roadmap, not a data dump.  

**Example (Fictional):**  
The Data & Insights team becomes Maria‚Äôs guide. Our plan: analyse by category and timeline, identify root causes, and recommend fixes.

## 4. Explore Data Insights ‚Äì The Story‚Äôs Middle (15 minutes)

**Purpose:** Uncover insights that support the story.  

**Instructions:**
- **Analyse for Key Findings:** Identify 2‚Äì3 major insights.  
- **Ask ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù and Add Context:** Numbers alone aren‚Äôt enough.  
- **Humanise the Data:** Add short anecdotes or resident examples.  
- **Use Plain Language:** Avoid jargon, keep it audience-friendly.  
- **Identify Tension:** Highlight bottlenecks or risks revealed by the data.  

**Example (Fictional):**  
Housing repair complaints = 45% of all cases, peaking in January. Only 60% resolved within 10 days vs 85% in other services. A resident waited 4 weeks for boiler repair.  

---

## 5. Define the Outcome and Stakes (10 minutes)

**Purpose:** Establish the **ending scenarios** ‚Äì success vs failure.  

**Instructions:**
- **Outcome (Success):** What happens if the plan is adopted?  
- **Stakes (Failure):** What if nothing changes?  
- **Write Two Statements:** One outcome, one stakes.  

**Example (Fictional):**  
- **Outcome:** With more staff, resolution rates could rise from 60% to 90% on time, improving satisfaction.  
- **Stakes:** Without action, complaints may double in a year and risk regulatory failure.  

---

## 6. Craft a Clear Call to Action (5 minutes)

**Purpose:** Deliver the recommendation.  

**Instructions:**
- **Decide the Action:** What must the hero do?  
- **Be Concise:** One clear, specific statement.  
- **Make It Impactful:** Link to the outcome.  
- **Check Feasibility:** Ensure it‚Äôs realistic and within the hero‚Äôs control.  

**Example (Fictional):**  
‚ÄúAssign additional staff to the housing repairs team and introduce a daily tracking report to monitor complaints.‚Äù  

---

## 7. Build the Narrative Arc (10 minutes)

**Purpose:** Assemble a coherent story.  

**Structure:**
- **Beginning:** Hero + problem.  
- **Middle:** Insights and findings.  
- **End:** Call to action, outcome, stakes.  

**Tips:**
- Write a short summary in story form.  
- Keep the hero in focus.  
- Add human/emotional touches.  
- Ensure clarity and logical flow.  

**Example (Fictional):**  
‚ÄúSix months after launching the system, complaints surged 25%. Maria turned to the data team. We discovered housing repairs were the main issue, with only 60% resolved on time. Our recommendation: assign staff and track daily. If acted upon, resolution can hit 90% and restore trust. If ignored, complaints could double.‚Äù

## 8. Group Presentations & Debrief (15‚Äì20 minutes)

**Purpose:** Share and reflect.  

**Instructions:**
- **Time to Present:** 3 minutes per group.  
- **Focus on the Narrative:** Cover hero, problem, guide, plan, insights, CTA, outcome, stakes.  
- **Optional Visuals:** Simple and supportive, not distracting.  
- **Active Listening:** Audience notes likes/questions.  

**Debrief:**
- What was challenging?  
- How did narrative framing change your view of the data?  
- Highlight creative or human elements.  
- Discuss how this applies to real work.  

**Wrap-Up:**  
Storytelling with data = turning facts into action. 

Keep practising the **Hero‚ÄìProblem‚ÄìGuide‚ÄìPlan‚ÄìOutcome‚ÄìStakes** framework for maximum impact.
