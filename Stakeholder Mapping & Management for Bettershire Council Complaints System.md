# Group Workshop: Stakeholder Mapping & Management for Bettershire Council Complaints System

## Workshop Aim

Help participants practise identifying, categorising, and managing stakeholders using the new Complaints Management System case study.

---

## Step 1: Introduce the Tool (10 mins)

* Briefly explain the **Stakeholder Management Grid (Power–Interest Matrix)**:

  * **High Power, High Interest → Manage Closely**
  * **High Power, Low Interest → Keep Satisfied**
  * **Low Power, High Interest → Keep Informed**
  * **Low Power, Low Interest → Monitor**
* Show an example grid (blank template).

---

## Step 2: Group Brainstorm – Identify Stakeholders (15 mins)

In breakout groups (3–5 people):

* List all possible stakeholders in the Bettershire Council case study.
* Encourage a broad sweep (internal staff, leadership, citizens, regulators, councillors, service managers, IT, press/media, advocacy groups).

Example starter list from the case:

* Residents / Citizens submitting complaints
* Council Leadership Team (CEO, Directors)
* Service Managers (Adult Social Care, Waste Services, etc.)
* Regulatory Bodies (Ombudsman, Care Quality Commission)
* Elected Councillors / Cabinet Members
* Complaints Handling Team
* IT/Digital Transformation Team
* Staff Unions / Advocacy Groups
* Media / Press

* Each group plots their identified stakeholders onto the grid.
* Discuss why they placed them in those quadrants.
* Consider questions like:

  * Who has the power to approve/reject changes?
  * Who cares most about outcomes and KPIs?
  * Who could block progress if ignored?
  * Who needs reassurance and communication?

---

## Step 4: Stakeholder Management Strategies (20 mins)

* For 2–3 key stakeholders in each quadrant, write down:

  * **Best engagement approach** (consultation, regular updates, dashboard access, town halls, etc.)
  * **Communication style** (formal reporting, quick updates, storytelling with visuals, etc.)
  * **Frequency of contact** (monthly reviews, weekly meetings, annual reports).
* Encourage groups to think how the **data storytelling approach** (context, human stories, early wins) could be tailored for each stakeholder.

---

## Step 5: Group Presentations (15 mins)

* Each group presents their grid and explains:

  * Who they placed in each quadrant.
  * One key engagement strategy they’d use.
* Compare similarities and differences across groups.

---

## Step 6: Wrap-Up & Reflection (10 mins)

Facilitator-led discussion:

* What did we learn about stakeholder differences?
* How can data storytelling make stakeholder engagement more effective?
* What would happen if one key group were ignored?
